# KonasRewrite

When I saw Konas 1.0 I thought that it might actually be good and as a result of 3 months of silence the client might've actually become good.

I was quickly disappointed to see that the client actually became worse.

Modules are now even more broken, new GUI styles look very bad, and it looks like 3 months went into making good ESP.

Konas still isn't worth $15, and you can download RusherHack for free which is still superior compared to this shit client.
